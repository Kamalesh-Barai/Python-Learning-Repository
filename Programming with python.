# 'number2' to store numbers. Then we will use another variable 'result' to 
# store their sum.

# "Hello" is a string type data. We can see data type by 'type' function.

# Integer type data. A whole number; a number that is not a fraction.

# We have to use single quotation or double qoutation to make string.

# When we do mathematical operation between two numbers, they have to be
# same data type. Otherwise python will try to convert them as same data type.
# If we add a integer and float variable then sum will be float data type.
# But python can not add integer with string.
